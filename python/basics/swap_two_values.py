# Record a value from user and store in var a
a = input("a: ")
# Record a value from user and store in var b
b = input("b: ")

# Print the recorded values of a and b
# -> write your code below this line

# Algorithm (step by step process):
#
# 1) Initiate a temporary variable (example
#    variable "c") and assign value of "a"
#    to the temporary variable
#
# 2) Assign the value of "b" to variable "a"
#
# 3) Assign the value of temporary variable
#    (original value of "a") to variable "b"
